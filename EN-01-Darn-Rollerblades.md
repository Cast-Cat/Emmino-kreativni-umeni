**Darn Rollerblades**

It was a beautiful sunny day, and Emma decided to go rollerblading in the park with Jirka. She loved the feeling of freedom as she sped along the smooth asphalt. But that day, everything went wrong. On a fast descent from a gentle slope, she lost control of her rollerblades. She tried to brake, but the blades got stuck on the edge of the path, and she crashed hard onto the asphalt.

She felt a sharp pain in her elbow as she hit the ground. She tried to get up, but her arm refused to move. Jirka, who was skating a little behind her, immediately stopped and rushed to help. "Are you okay?" he asked, but Emma just shook her head, tears of pain streaming down her cheeks. She knew something was wrong. Jirka helped her up, took off her skates, and carefully led her to the car, which luckily wasn't far away, to take her to the hospital.

In the car, Emma tried to take deep breaths, but the pain was becoming almost unbearable. Jirka comforted her and drove as carefully as possible to avoid hurting her more. When they arrived at the hospital, she was immediately taken to the emergency room.

When they arrived, she was quickly seated in a wheelchair and taken to the emergency room. A nurse gently helped her take off her sports shirt, and Emma realized how helpless she felt. The doctor arrived quickly, his face showing compassion and professionalism. "This doesn't look good," he said after a quick examination, "we'll see more after the X-ray."

Emma was first sent for an X-ray. She felt her heart rate increase as the medical staff moved her onto a hard metal table. She tried to stay calm while the radiologist carefully positioned her arm. Within a few minutes, the images were ready, and the doctor examined them carefully. "The fracture is clean, but it will need more time to heal," he said.

He sent Emma to the casting room. They laid her on a stretcher next to a stand with strange cones. A skillful nurse slipped a gentle stocking over her arm, cut a hole for the thumb, and put a tiny sock on it. She hung Emma's arm on the stand by her fingers so that the elbow was at the right angle, and gave her a pain relief injection. Then she began wrapping the arm with soft cotton and padded it with felt material at the joints. Then the doctor came and adjusted the arm into the right position while the nurse was preparing the plaster rolls.

The doctor carefully applied the splint, which he reinforced with several layers of plaster, continually checking the correct angle until the plaster started to harden. Emma felt the plaster gradually becoming heavier and firmer, encasing her arm from shoulder to fingertips. Finally, the nurse pulled the ends of the stocking over the edge of the plaster at the fingers, thumb, and shoulder, finishing the plaster with the last layer, carefully smoothing its surface.

When the plaster was finally finished, Emma felt like her entire arm was in a soft yet perfectly encasing prison. The plaster was firm, her arm immobilized, and although it provided relief from the pain, she also realized how limiting it would be in the coming weeks.

"Done," the doctor said, smiling at her. "Now just rest and let it heal. Before we discharge you, the plaster needs to set a bit more, so just lie here, and the nurse will check on you shortly."

Emma, a young woman of about twenty-five years old, could be a symbol of strength and determination. She thought of herself as always ready to face new challenges with grace and composure. This wasn't quite working out for her now, lying on a hospital bed with her arm in plaster. Her long red hair was braided into a ponytail, which she liked to keep out of her way while doing sports. It contrasted nicely with her light blue pastel sports shirt and light pink short skirt above the knees. She loved her light purple underwear, though she just noticed her favorite bra was now covered in white plaster smudges.

Emma looked at her arm, now seemingly not even hers, hidden under plaster from shoulder to fingertips. Suddenly, the nurse rushed in and gently helped her to get up, wiped off the remaining plaster residue from her fingers, shoulder, and the purple bra with a damp cloth, leaving wet spots where the white smudges had been. "Hopefully, it'll wash out," Emma thought.

Next, it was time to put on her sports shirt, which wasn't easy due to the tight sleeve. However, the nurse had evidently done this before and knew exactly how to handle it. She carefully guided Emma's arm in plaster through the sleeve and then secured it with a black strap with Velcro, which contrasted with her light-colored clothes. The strap went across her back and over her other shoulder to relieve the injured arm.

"Great!" Emma muttered, "At least it matches my shoes."

Emma suspected that she would face weeks, maybe even months, with this new reality. Thoughts swirled in her head. How would she manage to get dressed? How would she handle her daily tasks? One thing she knew for sureâ€”she had to find a way to cope.

George supported her as they left the hospital. "Don't worry, Emma," he said reassuringly. "We'll all help you until you recover."

Emma settled into the car seat next to George, who carefully drove them home. She slowly got used to the new weight of her arm and the limited movement. At home, George carefully helped Emma out of the car and adjusted the strap on her shoulder to keep the plaster in the right position. "We should set up a comfortable spot for you on the couch," he suggested as they walked inside.

"Thanks, George," Emma said wearily. "I'll need to get used to a new routine."

George smiled. "Don't worry, you'll get used to it. And I'll be here to help you with anything you need."
